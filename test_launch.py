"""Tests for launch — thread-row parsing and archive-candidate detection.

Builds tiny fixture INDEX.md files (real per-session table shape) and asserts:
live vs settled rows are both detected, the memory column is read from the
right position, and a session only becomes an archive candidate when EVERY
one of its threads is settled. Run: python3 test_launch.py
