"""Launch continuation chats in new terminal windows; report archive candidates.

Reads the INDEX.md of each meditation session and does two things:
(1) opens a new Claude Code terminal for every live (🟢) thread, with the
    right working directory and kickoff prompt;
(2) reports which SESSIONS are fully settled (every thread ✅) so they're
    ready to archive.

This script never calls `archive_session` itself — it can't: that's an MCP
tool, only callable by a live Claude Code agent, not a standalone Python
process. It only detects and reports; the agent running /meditate does the
actual confirmed archive call (see SKILL.md Phase B4). Rule 0 shape: script
computes the WHAT, agent performs the part that needs the real tool call.
