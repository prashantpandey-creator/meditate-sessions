"""The gate that ships WITH the product, runnable by someone who bought it.

`test_packaging.py` guards the working checkout's install story and imports
`doctor` — a companion module. Shipping it would hand a buyer a suite that
errors on a module the product deliberately does not contain, so the product
gets its own gate: this file, which touches nothing outside the 13 shipped
modules.

What it pins is the failure a buyer actually hits: a module that only worked
because it was sitting next to the author's other 35 files, or a path that
only exists on one Mac.

Run: python3 test_product.py
